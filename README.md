# Live Demo for Interactive Sessions on `serc`

Welcome to the [SDSS Center for Computation](https://sdss-compute.stanford.edu/)! We provide many computing resources including access to the `serc` partition on [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/), a supercomputer here on campus. Using `serc` give you priority access to compute machines within Sherlock. Today we'll get you started on using `serc` resources in an interactive capacity, which allows you to interact with the Sherlock supercomputer and the Oak storage space as if you were using your own laptop.

### Live Code Agenda:
1. Open an [interactive session](https://ondemand.sherlock.stanford.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sessions), pointing to Oak
2. Create a new notebook, and use [Globus](https://www.globus.org/) to confirm the notebook file is saved in Oak
3. Clone [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/stanford-sdss/serc_live_demo/tree/main) into Oak and interact using `serc`
4. Run an [example notebook](https://github.com/stanford-sdss/serc_live_demo/blob/main/notebooks/interactive_demo.ipynb), and save the outcomes to Oak
