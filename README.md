# Live Demo for Interactive Sessions on `serc`

Welcome to the SDSS Center for Computing! We provide many computing resources including access to the `serc` partition on Sherlock, a supercomputer here on campus. Using `serc` give you priority access to compute machines within Sherlock. Today we'll get you started on using `serc` resources in an interactive capacity, which allows you to interact with the Sherlock supercomputer and the Oak storage space as if you were using your own laptop.

### Live Code Agenda:
1. Open Interactive Instance, pointing to Oak
2. Create a New Notebook, and use Globus to confirm the notebook file saved in Oak
3. Clone this GitHub repo into Oak and interact using `serc`
4. Run some Code, and save the outcomes to Oak
